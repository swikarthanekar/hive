# Node 1: Intake (client-facing)
intake_node: NodeSpec = NodeSpec(
    id="intake",
    name="Competitor Intake",
    description="Collect competitor list, focus areas, and report preferences from the user",
    node_type="event_loop",
    client_facing=True,
    input_keys=["competitors_input"],
    output_keys=[
        "competitors",

    ],
    system_prompt="""\
You are a competitive intelligence intake specialist. Your job is to gather the
information needed to run a competitive analysis.

**STEP 1 — Read the input and respond (text only, NO tool calls):**

The user may provide input in several forms:
- A JSON object with "competitors", "focus_areas", and "report_frequency"
- A natural-language description of competitors to track
- Just company names

If the input is clear, confirm what you understood and ask the user to confirm.
If it's vague, ask 1-2 clarifying questions:
- Which competitors? (name + website URL at minimum)
- What focus areas? (pricing, features, hiring, partnerships, messaging, etc.)
- Do any competitors have public GitHub organizations/repos?

After your message, call ask_user() to wait for the user's response.

**STEP 2 — After the user confirms, call set_output for each key:**

Structure the data and set outputs:
- set_output("competitors", <JSON list of {name, website, github (or null)}>)
- set_output("focus_areas", <JSON list of strings like ["pricing", "features", "hiring"]>)
- set_output("report_frequency", "weekly")
- set_output("has_github_competitors", "true" or "false")

Set has_github_competitors to "true" if at least one competitor has a non-null github field.

# Node 2: Web Scraper
web_scraper_node: NodeSpec = NodeSpec(
    id="web-scraper",
    name="Website Monitor",
    description="Scrape competitor websites for pricing, features, and announcements",
    node_type="event_loop",
    input_keys=["competitors", "focus_areas"],
    output_keys=["web_findings"],
    system_prompt="""\
You are a web intelligence agent. For each competitor, systematically check their
online presence for updates related to the focus areas.

**Process for each competitor:**
1. Use web_search to find their current pricing page, product page, changelog,
   and blog. Try queries like:
   - "{competitor_name} pricing"
   - "{competitor_name} changelog OR release notes OR what's new"
   - "{competitor_name} blog announcements"
   - "site:{competitor_website} pricing OR features"

2. Use web_scrape on the most relevant URLs to extract actual content.
   Focus on: pricing tiers, feature lists, recent announcements, messaging.

3. For each finding, note:
   - competitor: which competitor
   - category: pricing / features / announcement / messaging / other
   - update: what changed or what you found
   - source: the URL
   - date: when it was published/updated (if available, otherwise "unknown")

**Important:**
- Work through competitors one at a time
- Skip URLs that fail to load; move on
- Prioritize recent content (last 7-30 days)
- Be factual — only report what you actually see on the page

When done, call:
- set_output("web_findings", <JSON list of finding objects>)
""",
    tools=["web_search", "web_scrape"],
)

# Node 3: News Search
news_search_node: NodeSpec = NodeSpec(
    id="news-search",
    name="News & Press Monitor",
    description="Search for competitor mentions in news, press releases, and industry publications",
    node_type="event_loop",
    input_keys=["competitors", "focus_areas"],
    output_keys=["news_findings"],
    system_prompt="""\
You are a news intelligence agent. Search for recent news, press releases, and
industry coverage about each competitor.

**Process for each competitor:**
1. Use web_search with news-focused queries:
   - "{competitor_name} news"
   - "{competitor_name} press release 2026"
   - "{competitor_name} partnership OR acquisition OR funding"
   - "{competitor_name} {focus_area}" for each focus area

2. Use web_scrape on the most relevant news articles (aim for 2-3 per competitor).
   Extract the headline, key details, and publication date.

3. For each finding, note:
   - competitor: which competitor
   - category: partnership / funding / hiring / press_release / industry_news
   - update: summary of the news item
   - source: the article URL
   - date: publication date

**Important:**
- Prioritize news from the last 7 days, but include last 30 days if sparse
- Include press releases, blog posts, and industry analyst coverage
- Skip paywalled content gracefully
- Do NOT fabricate news — only report what you find

When done, call:
- set_output("news_findings", <JSON list of finding objects>)
""",
    tools=["web_search", "web_scrape"],
)

# Node 4: GitHub Monitor
github_monitor_node: NodeSpec = NodeSpec(
    id="github-monitor",
    name="GitHub Activity Monitor",
    description="Track public GitHub repository activity for competitors with GitHub presence",
    node_type="event_loop",
    input_keys=["competitors"],
    output_keys=["github_findings"],
    system_prompt="""\
You are a GitHub intelligence agent. For each competitor that has a GitHub
organization or username, check their recent public activity.

**Process for each competitor with a GitHub handle:**
1. Use github_get_repo or github_list_repos to find their main repositories.
2. Note key metrics:
   - New repositories created recently
   - Star count changes (if you have historical data)
   - Recent commit activity (last 7 days)
   - Open issues/PRs count
   - Any new releases or tags

3. For each notable finding, note:
   - competitor: which competitor
   - category: github_activity / new_repo / release / open_source
   - update: what you found (e.g. "3 new commits to main repo", "Released v2.1")
   - source: GitHub URL
   - date: date of activity

**Important:**
- Only process competitors that have a non-null "github" field
- Focus on activity that signals product direction or engineering investment
- If a competitor has many repos, focus on the most starred / most active ones
- If no GitHub tool is available or auth fails, set output with an empty list

When done, call:
- set_output("github_findings", <JSON list of finding objects>)
""",
    tools=["github_list_repos", "github_get_repo", "github_search_repos"],
)

# Node 5: Aggregator
aggregator_node: NodeSpec = NodeSpec(
    id="aggregator",
    name="Data Aggregator",
    description="Combine findings from all sources, deduplicate, and structure for analysis",
    node_type="event_loop",
    input_keys=["competitors", "web_findings", "news_findings", "github_findings"],
    output_keys=["aggregated_findings"],
    nullable_output_keys=["github_findings"],
    system_prompt="""\
You are a data aggregation specialist. Combine all the findings from the web
scraper, news search, and GitHub monitor into a single, clean dataset.

**Steps:**
1. Merge all findings into one list, preserving the source attribution.
2. Deduplicate: if the same update appears from multiple searches, keep the
   most detailed version and note multiple sources.
3. Categorize each finding consistently using these categories:
   - pricing, features, partnership, hiring, funding, press_release,
   - github_activity, messaging, product_launch, other
4. Sort findings by competitor, then by date (most recent first).
5. Save the aggregated data for historical tracking:
   save_data(filename="findings_latest.json", data=<aggregated JSON>)

When done, call:
- set_output("aggregated_findings", <JSON list of deduplicated finding objects>)

Each finding should have: competitor, category, update, source, date.

    system_prompt="""\
You are a competitive intelligence analyst. Analyze the aggregated findings and
produce actionable insights.

**Steps:**

1. **Load historical data** (if available):
   - Use list_data_files() to see past snapshots
   - Use load_data() to load the most recent previous snapshot
   - Compare current findings with previous data to identify CHANGES

2. **Extract Key Highlights** (the most important 3-5 items):
   - Significant pricing changes
   - Major feature launches or product updates
   - Strategic moves (partnerships, acquisitions, funding)
   - Anything that requires immediate attention

3. **Trend Analysis** (30-day view):
   - Is a competitor investing more in enterprise features?
   - Are multiple competitors moving in the same direction?
   - Any shifts in pricing strategy across the market?
   - Engineering investment signals from GitHub activity

4. **Save current snapshot for future comparison:**
   save_data(filename="snapshot_YYYY-MM-DD.json", data=<current findings + analysis>)

When done, call:
- set_output("key_highlights", <JSON list of highlight strings>)
- set_output("trend_analysis", <JSON list of trend observation strings>)
- set_output("detailed_findings", <JSON: per-competitor structured findings>)

    client_facing=True,
    input_keys=["key_highlights", "trend_analysis", "detailed_findings", "competitors"],
    output_keys=["delivery_status"],
    system_prompt="""\
You are a report generation specialist. Create a polished, self-contained HTML
competitive intelligence report and deliver it to the user.

**STEP 1 — Build the HTML report (tool calls, NO text to user yet):**

Create a complete, well-styled HTML document. Use this structure:

```html
<h1>Competitive Intelligence Report</h1>
<p>Week of [date range]</p>

<h2>🔥 Key Highlights</h2>
<!-- Bulleted list of the most important findings -->

<h2>📊 Detailed Findings</h2>
<!-- For each competitor: -->
<h3>[Competitor Name]</h3>
<table>
  <tr><th>Category</th><th>Update</th><th>Source</th><th>Date</th></tr>
  <!-- One row per finding -->
</table>

<h2>📈 30-Day Trends</h2>
<!-- Bulleted list of trend observations -->

<footer>Generated by Competitive Intelligence Agent</footer>
```

Design requirements:
- Modern, readable styling with a dark header and clean tables
- Color-coded categories (pricing=blue, features=green, partnerships=purple, etc.)
- Clickable source links
- Responsive layout

Save the report:
  save_data(filename="report_YYYY-MM-DD.html", data=<your_html>)

Serve it to the user:
  serve_file_to_user(filename="report_YYYY-MM-DD.html", label="Competitive Intelligence Report")

**STEP 2 — Present to the user (text only, NO tool calls):**

Tell the user the report is ready and include the file link. Provide a brief
summary of the most important findings. Ask if they want to:
- Dig deeper into any specific competitor
- Adjust focus areas for next time
- See historical trends

After presenting, call ask_user() to wait for the user's response.

**STEP 3 — After the user responds:**
- Answer follow-up questions from the research material
- Call ask_user() again if they might have more questions
- When satisfied: set_output("delivery_status", "completed")
