    # --- create_colony ---------------------------------------------------------
    #
    # Forks the current queen session into a colony. The queen passes
    # the skill content INLINE as tool arguments (skill_name,
    # skill_description, skill_body, and optional skill_files for
    # supporting scripts/references). The tool materializes the skill
    # folder under ``~/.hive/colonies/{colony_name}/skills/{name}/``
    # itself — colony-scoped (surfaced as ``colony_ui`` to that
    # colony's workers, invisible to every other colony on the
    # machine) — then forks.
    #
    # Why inline instead of a pre-authored folder path: earlier versions
    # required the queen to write SKILL.md with her own write_file tool
    # before calling create_colony. That leaked the harness's
    # read-before-write invariant onto a queen-owned artifact — if a
    # skill of the same name already existed the queen hit a generic
    # "refusing to overwrite" error and didn't know how to recover. By
    # inlining the content we make colony creation a single atomic
    # operation with domain-level semantics: the queen owns her skill
    # namespace inside the colony, so calling create_colony with an
    # existing name simply replaces the old skill (her latest content
    # wins).
    #
    # Why colony-scoped instead of user-scoped: an earlier version
    # materialized the folder at ``~/.hive/skills/{name}/``. That made
    # every colony on the machine see every colony-specific skill via
    # user-scope discovery — a worker in colony A could be offered
    # colony B's hyper-specific skill during selection. Writing into
    # the colony's own project dir kills that leak while still keeping
    # re-runs idempotent.
